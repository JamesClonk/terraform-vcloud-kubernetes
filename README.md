### Components on cluster

| Component | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/) | Storage | Highly available persistent storage for Kubernetes, provides cloud-native block storage with backup functionality |
| [Ingress NGINX](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) | Routing | Provides HTTP traffic routing, load balancing, SSL termination and name-based virtual hosting |
| [Cert Manager](https://cert-manager.io/) | Certificates | Cloud-native, automated TLS certificate management and [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) integration for Kubernetes |
| [Hairpin Proxy](https://github.com/compumike/hairpin-proxy) | Proxy | PROXY protocol support for internal-to-LoadBalancer traffic for Kubernetes Ingresses, specifically for passing cert-manager self-checks |
| [Kubernetes Dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard) | Dashboard | A general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters that allows users to manage and troubleshoot applications on the cluster, as well as manage the cluster itself |
| [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) | Metrics | An open-source systems monitoring and alerting platform, collects and stores metrics in a time series database |
| [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) | Logs | A horizontally scalable, highly available log aggregation and storage system |
| [Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/) | Logs | An agent which collects and ships the contents of logs on Kubernetes into the Loki log storage |
| [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/) | Dashboard | Allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand all of your Kubernetes metrics and logs |

# TODO:

This still needs to be done to finish this repo. The text here and below will be removed before its done and ready for `v1.0.0`.

- [x] add this TODO list ðŸ˜‚
- [x] change SSH procedure from root/pw to ssh-keys
  - [x] add ssh-keys to variables / tfvars, remove root passwords
  - [x] change VM/node setup in `infrastructure` module on vcloud
  - [x] change VM/node access for K3s setup in `kubernetes` module
- [ ] write proper, extensive documentation
  - [ ] overhaul README.md
  - [ ] add all documentation it into a /docs subdir, as per tf convention
  - [ ] Explain architecture picture, document decisions and setup
  - [ ] Requirements for DCS tenant: VDC, Edge Gateway with Internet
  - [ ] Installation instructions, full in-depth guide with screenshots
  - [ ] Configuration instructions, explain all tfvars / variables in detail
  - [ ] Module description, for each of the 3 submodules
  - [ ] Customization, explain possible customization options to users
  - [ ] Day 2 operations, component and cluster upgrades
  - [ ] Document access to components, Grafana and Kubernetes-Dashboard specifically, with screenshots
  - [ ] Document user token creation for Kubernetes-Dashboard access
- [x] add Prometheus to `deployments` module
  - [x] make it optional via boolean flag and `count = var.flag ? 1 : 0` in resource, to be disabled by default?
- [ ] add Loki to `deployments` module
  - [ ] make it optional via boolean flag and `count = var.flag ? 1 : 0` in resource, to be disabled by default?
- [x] add Grafana to `deployments` module
  - [x] customize Grafana with local admin user, to be provided via variables / tfvars
  - [x] Add ingress to Grafana for access
  - [x] Output Grafana Ingress URL at the end for the user
  - [x] make it optional via boolean flag and `count = var.flag ? 1 : 0` in resource, to be disabled by default?
- [x] Output Kubernetes-Dashboard Ingress URL at the end for the user
- [x] Add Helm chart and component versions to variables / tfvars
- [x] Make sure loadbalancer rules cover everything
  - [x] k8s-api for cp, http and https ports for workers, entire nodeport range for workers
  - [x] should bastion host SSH stay via DNAT or also be ported onto the loadbalancer?

#### Maybe in the future?
- [ ] Replace standalone K3s control plane with Rancher module control plane
  - [ ] Deploy Rancher control plane after Bastion host
  - [ ] Deploy "workload" cluster (with its own cp) through Rancher tf module

To consider: A standalone Rancher control plane just for one single workload cluster might be overkill? ðŸ¤”
